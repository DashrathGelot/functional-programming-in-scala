## Review :- Imperative Programming Language

* Modifying mutable varables
* using assignments 
* and constrol statement like if-then-else, loops, breack, continue, return

## What is Theory

in mathematics a theory consists

* one or more data types 
* operation on this types
* laws that describes relationship between values and operation

Normally, a theory does not describe mutation !

## Theories without mutataions

For instance the theory of polynomials describes the sum of two polynomials by laws such as :

```
(a*x + b) + (c*x + d) = (a + c)*x + (b + d)
```
